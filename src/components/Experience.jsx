      title: "Software Engineer Intern",
      company: "Schneider Electric",
      period: "May 2025 - Present",
      description: "I engineered an agentic co-pilot using a Large Language Model (LLM) and LlamaIndex to translate natural language into database queries, which reduced client data retrieval time by 25%. I also designed a multi-agent architecture in Python, where a central Coordinator Agent delegated tasks to specialized Function Agents (Knowledge, Metrics, Invoice), improving query efficiency by 30%. Additionally, I implemented and trained an intelligent MCP client that dynamically selects tools from the MCP server and passes the necessary parameters, achieving 95% task automation. Further, I developed the central backend for all AI agent operations by building a multi-tool Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with FastAPI and containerized it using Docker.",

I built data pipelines with Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, increasing accuracy by 15% in bacterial resistance analysis. I also designed differential equation models, used SQLite and Jupyter Notebooks, and created agent-based models with PyTorch and MLflow, boosting prediction accuracy by 10%.",
